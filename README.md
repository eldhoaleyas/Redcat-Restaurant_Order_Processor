# Redcat-Restaurant_Order_Processor
Coding Challenge - Restaurant Order Processor

 
This is a command-line application built in Python for the Redcat Software Engineer Coding Challenge.
 
The application allows a user to select items from a predefined menu, calculates line item subtotals, and provides a final receipt breakdown including the total price and the 10% Goods and Services Tax (GST).



Example output:
——————————————————————————

Cheeseburger x 2 $30.00
Soft drink (Large) x 1 $5.00


Total $35.00
Including GST ($3.18)
